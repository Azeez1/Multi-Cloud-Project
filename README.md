# **Secure CI/CD Pipeline with Compliance Automation & Multi-Cloud Deployments**

## **Overview**
This project implements a **secure, multi-cloud CI/CD pipeline** that deploys a containerized application to both **AWS EKS** and **Azure AKS**. It includes **automated vulnerability scanning**, **secret detection**, **runtime security monitoring**, and **compliance checks** to ensure best practices in cloud security.

## **Architecture & Flow**
1. **Developers** push code to GitHub (main branch).  
2. **GitHub Actions** runs the following checks:
   - **GitLeaks** for hardcoded secrets.
   - **Checkov & Terrascan** for IaC misconfigurations.
   - **Trivy** for container vulnerabilities.
3. **Terraform & Terragrunt** deploy the app to **AWS EKS** and **Azure AKS** using a **DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself)** approach.
4. **Kubernetes** pods fetch secrets from **HashiCorp Vault** dynamically.
5. **Falco** & **OPA/Gatekeeper** enforce runtime security and policy compliance at the cluster level.
6. **AWS GuardDuty** & **Azure Defender** provide cloud-native threat monitoring.

## **Key Features**

1. **Secret Management (HashiCorp Vault)**
   - Dynamically inject secrets into Kubernetes pods.
   - Vault policies configured to restrict unauthorized access.

2. **Compliance-as-Code (Checkov, Terrascan, OPA)**
   - Checks Terraform for security misconfigurations (e.g., unencrypted S3 buckets).
   - OPA/Gatekeeper blocks privileged pods and enforces resource limits.

3. **Container Vulnerability Scanning (Trivy)**
   - Scans Docker images for CVEs prior to deployment.

4. **Secret Detection (GitLeaks)**
   - Detects accidental commits of AWS keys, tokens, and other sensitive info.

5. **Multi-Cloud Deployment (AWS & Azure)**
   - **Terraform & Terragrunt** manage identical infrastructure in both clouds.
   - AWS EKS & Azure AKS clusters for improved redundancy.

6. **Runtime Security (Falco)**
   - Real-time monitoring of container behaviors.
   - Alerts on suspicious network calls and system-level anomalies.

7. **Cloud-Native Security (GuardDuty & Azure Defender)**
   - AWS GuardDuty monitors malicious activity across AWS.
   - Azure Defender provides agentless VM scanning and threat detection in Azure.

## **Tools & Services Used**
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD automation
- **Checkov & Terrascan**: IaC scanning
- **Trivy**: Container vulnerability scanner
- **GitLeaks**: Hardcoded secret detection
- **Vault**: Centralized secrets management
- **AWS EKS & Azure AKS**: Managed Kubernetes services
- **Terraform & Terragrunt**: Infrastructure provisioning
- **Falco**: Runtime security monitoring for Kubernetes
- **OPA/Gatekeeper**: Kubernetes policy enforcement
- **AWS GuardDuty & Azure Defender**: Threat detection in each cloud

## **Accomplished Steps**

1. **Kubernetes & Vault Setup**
   - Installed Kubernetes Dashboard.
   - Deployed & initialized Vault in-cluster.
   - Configured Kubernetes authentication in Vault.

2. **CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)**
   - Integrated GitLeaks for secret scanning.
   - Added Checkov & Terrascan for IaC security checks.
   - Introduced Trivy for container scanning.
   - Used Terraform & Terragrunt for multi-cloud deployments.

3. **Runtime Security**
   - Deployed **Falco** with Helm.
   - Configured **OPA/Gatekeeper** to deny privileged pods.

4. **Cloud Security**
   - Enabled **AWS GuardDuty** with `aws guardduty create-detector`.
   - Enabled **Azure Defender** with `az security pricing create --name VirtualMachines --tier Standard`.

5. **Project Completion**
   - Verified scans detect vulnerabilities in Docker images (intentional).
   - Terrascan & Checkov flagged Terraform misconfigurations (also intentional).
   - GuardDuty & Azure Defender are fully active.

## **Drawbacks & Challenges**

1. **Complexity of Multi-Cloud**  
   - Maintaining consistent security best practices across **AWS** and **Azure** can be intricate.  
   - **Solution**: Centralize policies with OPA/Gatekeeper & standardized IaC modules.

2. **False Positives** in Scans  
   - Tools like **Terrascan** or **Trivy** may report vulnerabilities that are low impact or easily mitigated.  
   - **Solution**: Fine-tune scanning rules and use `soft-fail` in Checkov until you refine policies.

3. **Performance & Resource Usage**  
   - Running multiple scanners (Checkov, Terrascan, Trivy, GitLeaks) can slow down CI pipelines.  
   - **Solution**: Configure parallel jobs and caching to reduce runtime overhead.

4. **Learning Curve**  
   - Tools like **Vault**, **OPA**, **Falco** have a significant learning curve.  
   - **Solution**: Start with default Helm charts, gradually incorporate advanced configurations.

## **Lessons Learned**

1. **Shift-Left Security**  
   - Integrating security checks early in the pipeline catches misconfigurations before production.  

2. **IaC Reusability**  
   - Using **Terragrunt** drastically simplifies multi-cloud deployments and code reusability.  

3. **Policy-Driven Environments**  
   - OPA/Gatekeeper enforces security policies at the cluster level, preventing risky deployments from day one.

4. **Continuous Monitoring**  
   - **Falco** + **GuardDuty** + **Azure Defender** provide comprehensive threat detection spanning containers and cloud resources.

5. **Automation is Key**  
   - With GitHub Actions, each commit automatically triggers scans, ensuring compliance remains continuous.

## **Future Enhancements**

1. **Automated Remediation**  
   - Implement policy-as-code to auto-fix misconfigurations.  
2. **Advanced Policies**  
   - Expand OPA rules to cover image tags, resource limits, network policies, etc.  
3. **Logging & SIEM Integration**  
   - Forward Falco events to a SIEM (Splunk, Elastic) for centralized alerting.  
4. **Performance Optimization**  
   - Parallelize more CI jobs, and cache scanning databases to speed up builds.

## **How to Use**

1. **Clone the Repo**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-org>/Multi-Cloud-Project.git
   ```
2. **Deploy to Multi-Cloud**  
   - Update credentials in GitHub secrets, then push or merge to **main**.  
   - GitHub Actions automatically runs security scans & deployments.  
3. **Monitor Security**  
   - **Falco** logs: `kubectl logs -n falco <falco-pod>`  
   - **OPA** constraints: `kubectl get constraints`  
   - **AWS GuardDuty**: AWS Console → GuardDuty  
   - **Azure Defender**: Azure Portal → Microsoft Defender for Cloud
